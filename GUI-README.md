Itâ€™s better to describe a concept of a controlled vocabulary with links into the LOD cloud than with plain strings. The Labeling System sets itself apart from usual SKOS editors by providing simple tools to create these links.

## Labeling System WORKBENCH

The Labeling System WORKBENCH is a web-based tool to create controlled vocabularies and their including concepts described using translations, descriptions as well as hierarchical, associative or mapping relations to other concepts.

The Labeling System consists of three big components: controlled vocabularies, concepts and agent. A agent is the owner of a controlled vocabulary and its containing concepts. The agent as a main role is described with metadata: title, first name, last name, ORCID and its affiliation.

First, create a new 'draft' "controlled vocabulary" that has a meaningful 'name', short 'description' and a preferred 'language' for all concepts inside your vocabulary. A draft vocabulary and its concepts can be fully deleted. As long as a vocabulary is in draft mode a concept can never be public. If your vocabulary should be public accessible set it 'public'. In the public mode it is not deletable anymore. Each vocabulary stores a list of thesauri for the search enrichment browser. In a concept view of a controlled vocabulary all belonging concepts and their 'quality' gives you an overview. All your vocabularies are shown in an overview showing name, descriptions and statistics.

Second, create a new 'draft' "concept" that has a 'name' in the language of your vocabulary ("thumbnail") and optionally a short 'description'. The concept can be enriched via descriptive patterns like adding a "translation", adding a "description" or adding a HTTP resource via the "wayback machine".

The full power of the LS Workbench is shown in the 'search enrichment browser'. In a first step, you are able to search keywords in several adjustable reference thesauri (e.g. Getty AAT). In a second step, your are able to set hierarchical (broadMatch, narrowMatch), associative (relatedMatch) and mapping relations (closeMatch, exactMatch) to these concepts. You are also able to set hierarchical (broader, narrower) and associative (related) relations to concepts in the same vocabulary via a list.

During the draft concept mode it is possible to modify and delete translations, description and links. A draft concept can be fully deleted. If your concept should be public accessible set it 'public'. In the public mode it is not deletable anymore, as well as [no longer changeable] OR [ony changeable for enrichments like adding a translation or a link to a new concept in a new reference thesaurus].
